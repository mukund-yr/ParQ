Version 1: First Iteration (as of 10/25/17)
Parq is web application as a way for users to book parking spots as well as post parking spots to rent out
to potential customers. Our goal is make it more convinient for drivers to find parking spots in large
metropolitan areas such as New York City.

In order to use the application, you must register for an account: going to the home page of the website 
prompts you to sign in. 

## Sign Up and Login
Clicking "Sign Up" on the top navigation bar allows you to fill out information to create an account. After
creating an account, you can then log in - which brings you to your personal profile page. Only one account per
email address. 

## Sign Out
Clicking "Sign Out" on the top navigation bar signs the user out, bringing them back into the login page. 

## Profile 
Right now, the profile does not have much: it consists of two options **Buyer** and **Seller**. Clicking "Profile" on the
top navigation bar brings you to the profile.

## Buyer
Clicking on "Buyer" brings you to a page that lists all the parking spots in the locale- essentially all of the spots stored
in the database. More sophisticated location filtering will be implemented in the later iteration. 

## Seller
Clicking on "Seller" brings you to a page where you can view all of the parking spots that make up your ** Garage **
or you can fill out and register any additional parking spots you have availible for Parq. 

## About
Clicking the "About" on the top navigation brings you to the page that gives a brief description about us.

TODO: 
## Update Contact
On your profile, you can choose to update information. For the time being, the only piece of information we allow to be changed
is the display name associated with the account (wouldn't make much sense to change the email...) This is just to show for our
first iteration that you are allowed to make changes to data associated with you as the user.
